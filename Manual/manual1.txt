Chapter 1 of the help menu: STARTING OUT.

        1 - STARTER PACK
            When you spawn for the first time, you get a starter pack which
            contains some useful stuff. For example, a few pieces of iron and 10 coins.

        1.1 - XP AND LEVELS
              When you leave the house, you get 10 XP. XP shows how much you have
              played the game. The more XP you have, the higher your level is. For example:
              level 2 is 100 XP. Level 5 is 300 XP and so on and so forth. At the start of
              the game you have 0 XP. You can view your amount of XP by typing xp().
