       2.1 - PURPOSES OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS
             Basic materials:
              Iron - with iron you can craft armor and tools. Also, you can repair them.

              Rare materials:
                Gold - with gold you can make jewelry. Jewelry does nothing. You can also forge coins
                       with gold but there is a chance that you will be caught. Gold can be sold to a
                       merchant for 10 coins and bought for 20 each.
                Bronze - bronze can be used in armor and weapons. However, bronze weapons and
                         armor are not as durable as the iron ones because iron is much harder.
