        3 - TYPES OF FOOD
              There are three types of food: vegetables, fruits and meat. Each of them restore the
              hunger points, but differently. Meat usually boosts your hunger by 5-7, whereas veg-
              etables only 3-5.
        3.1 - WHERE DOES THE FOOD APPEAR
              Vegetables - usually appear on trees, however you can either find them in the town or
                           buy them from a merchant. Some vegetables like potatoes or carrots spawn
                           underground.
              
              Fruits - usually appear on trees and bushed, however you can either find them in the
                       town or buy them from a merchant.

              Meat - can be obtained from animals. Animals can be found outside the town; but you
                     can kill animals in the town. There is a 1 to 3 chance that you will be caught
                     and fined.
