Chapter 4 of the help menu - LOCATIONS.
        4 - SPAWN
              You spawn in a small town called Johncenangton. Since it is a small, unremarkable town,
              you don't have much to do there. The people that live here are poor, but the ones that
              rule it are filthy rich.
        4.1 - CAVES
              Caves are useful places where you can find different ores. Some ores require you to melt
              them, but some don't. But be careful, the deeper you go, the bigger the chance of you
              falling and therefore dying.
        4.2 - BANDIT HIDEOUTS
              Bandit hideouts are places where you can find gold and emeralds. Usually not a lot, but
              if you're lucky, you can even get 3 emeralds at a bandit hideout! Also, remember that
              you must have an appropriate amount of XP or otherwise you WILL BE KILLED.
