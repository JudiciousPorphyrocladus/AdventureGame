        4 - TOWNS AND SPAWN
              You spawn in a small town called Johncenangton. Since it is a small, unremarkable town,
              you don't have much to do there. However, there are 2 chests hidden in the town!
              The second town is Bobuxbury. It is a town that's north-east from Johncenangton. There
              is a quest that gives you good loot, so it is quite worth to do it!
              The third town os Monkeville. You need at least 10th level to go there. There is a mer-
              chant that sells different kinds of materials, and sometimes you might even get a dis-
              count if the merchant needs your item!
              The last town in the game is Walterworth. Its level os 15 and it is the most developed
              town in the game. You can buy anything there. The King himself lives there!
        4.1 - BANDIT HIDEOUTS
              Bandit hideouts are places where you can find gold and emeralds. Usually not a lot, but
              if you're lucky, you can get even 3 emeralds at the bandit hideout! Also, remember that
              you must have the appropriate amount of XP or otherwise you will be killed by bandits.
